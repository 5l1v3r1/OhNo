OhNo - The Evil Image Builder &amp; Meta Manipulator

Exif Meta Tag Viewer and Editor of sorts. Uses the Mini_Exiftool Ruby Gem which is a wrapper for the CLI Exiftool. This is just some fun I was having to automate evil image building. There is an all-in-one version which houses GUI & CLI options and then there is the ohno-c version which is CLI only and has all of the Ruby-TK code removed (some people just dont like da GUI and some people had too many troubles getting Tk installed so take your pic).
